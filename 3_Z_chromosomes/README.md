# Section 3: The history of the Z chromosomes of *P. atlantica*.

[P_icarus_Z_chr](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/3_Z_chromosomes/P_icarus_Z_chr>)

Contains the data needed to plot PacBio coverage per scaffold in the *P. icarus* genome assembly shown in Figure S1D.

[merians_Picarus](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/3_Z_chromosomes/merians_Picarus>)

Contains code and files to generate the Merian painti shown in Figure S1E. The locations of BUSCOs and their Merian labels are found in TSV files, which are plotted using an R script (plot_coverage_and_repeat_density.R).
