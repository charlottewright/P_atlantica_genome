# Section 4: The W chromosomes of *P. atlantica* are derived from copies of three autosomes that became sex-linked

[alignments](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/4_W_chromosomes/alignments>)

Code used to generate alignments of the W chromosomes to the other sequences in the genome of *P. atlantica*. Alignments are plotted using the pafr package in R using an R script (analyse_minimap2_alignments.R). 

[oxford_plot](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/4_W_chromosomes/oxford_plot>)

Data and code needed to generate the oxford plot of Z chromosomes against the W chromosomes of *P. atlantica* shown in Figure 3B. Also includes the data needed to annotate the oxford plot with chromosome outlines with gene locations. These data are plotted using an R script (oxford_plots_sex_chr_by_facetting.R.)

[divergence](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/4_W_chromosomes/divergence>)

Data needed to plot the synonymous divergence between the W and Z chromosomes of *P. atlantica* in Figure 3C and 3D as well as Figure S3B, S4A-D. This data is plotted using an R script (plot_dS_distribution_Ws_vs_Zs.R).
