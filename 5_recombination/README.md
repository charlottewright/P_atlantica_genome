# Section 5: Divergence estimates suggest historical recombination between Z1 and W1 chromosomes

[divergence (in section 4_W_chromosomes)](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/4_W_chromosomes/divergence>)

Data needed to plot the synonymous divergence between the W and Z chromosomes of *P. atlantica* in Figure 3C and 3D as well as Figure S3B, S4A-D. This data is plotted using an R script (plot_dS_distribution_Ws_vs_Zs.R).
