# Section 6: Fissions occur in the A compartment and do not act to maintain clusters of functionally-related genes

[compartments](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/6_fissions/compartments/>)

Data needed to generate the Hi-C plotted annotated with the locations of various features using pyGenomeTracks, as shown in Figure 4A, and to estimate the overlap between compartment types and breakpoints, as shown in Figure S6. Figure S6 was generated by using an R script (get_overlap_stats.using_count_multi.per_chr.R). 

[gene_enrichment](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/6_fissions/gene_enrichment>)

Code needed to test for gene enrichment per observed and simulated block of genes. Data is plotted using an R script (plot_simulated_gene_enrichment_results.R).

[repeat_enrichment](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/6_fissions/repeat_enrichment/>)

Code and data needed to plot the observed distribution of repeat density in breakpoints compared to simulated repeat densities under a random model. Figure S5 was generated using an R script (compare_repeat_density_random_vs_observed_regions.R). This folder also contains the results of using the package regioner to test for overlap between breakpoints and repeats.

[hox_genes](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/6_fissions/hox_genes/>)

Data needed to plot the schematics of hox gene locations in *P. atlantica* and *P. icarus* shown in Figure 4B and 4C. Data is plotted using an R script (hox_cluster_analysis.R).
