# Section 6: Fissions occur in the A compartment and do not act to maintain clusters of functionally-related genes

[gene_enrichment](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/6_fissions/gene_enrichment>)

Code needed to test for gene enrichment per observed and simulated block of genes.

[repeat_enrichment](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/6_fissions/repeat_enrichment/>)

Data needed to plot the observed distribution of repeat density in breakpoints compared to simulated repeat densities under a random model.

[hox_genes](<https://github.com/charlottewright/P_atlantica_genome/tree/main/6_fissions/hox_genes/>)

Data needed to plot the schematics of hox gene locations in *P. atlantica* and *P. icarus* shown in Figure 4B and 4C. Data is plotted using an R script (hox_cluster_analysis.R).
